activator/inhibator

## Development

### Coding Conventions used:
https://www.gdquest.com/docs/guidelines/best-practices/blender-python/

### Visual Studio Code

I recommend, that you use Visual Studio Code, more features such as
autocomplete, syntax highlighting, integration with version control
systems and other tools that make development faster and easier:
